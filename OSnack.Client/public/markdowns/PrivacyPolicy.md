At OSnack, accessible from OSnack.co.uk, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by OSnack and how we use it.

Internet security is very important to us and you can be assured that we do everything we can to make sure your personal and card payment information is kept secure at all times. To protect you from fraud and to keep your transaction information safe and secure, OSnack uses a secure Internet payment service called PayPal and which employs encryption and various other up to date security techniques to ensure your transaction information is kept safe and secure at all times. 

If you have additional questions or require more information about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.

#### What information we hold about you
If you have bought something from us we will have your email address, phone number and shipping address. However, we do not store your credit card details. If you choose to deliver items to a third party (such as a friend), we will have their name and address. This information is only used to help us deliver the parcels and to contact you.

We also maintain an order history of your purchases. This allows you and us to track your deliveries and review your past purchases. We may offer you a reward for purchases or make an offer we think you might like based on your order history. We also collect information of a general nature about how many ‘hits’ our website gets. And we monitor the site traffic patterns; this tells us which areas of the site are being visited more than others. It also helps us build a more useful site in subsequent re-designs. We don’t track individual users’ pathways through the site.

#### What we do with the information
